## Mounts by Printer Voron
Page currently undergoing maintenance. 

The following .zip files includes .step and .DXF files of all the modular docks and mounts for CAD interchange.


Existing Voron 2.4’s can utilize the Fotek converstion mount or the modified AfterBurner shells offered below which locate the toolboard in the same location as the inductive probe.

Github user v6cl posted a video to Youtube that we came across and were impressed by their deployment. They designed a ‘skinny mount’ to open up the cooling vents in the toolhead.
