## How to get Euclid Probe

### Buy a kit from a reseller 
Due to numerous inquiries and customer demand, we have begun producing kits and make them available through select resellers.  Part of the proceeds of these sales directly support both the creators of Euclid Probe and the reseller. These funds provide for further research and development for Euclid Probe, the continual dock and mount creation and adaptations, and the ongoing firmware improvements. 

### We don't offshore 
We don't offshore the labor to package and label Euclid kits- we believe in the ethos of putting community first and that sound business practices can serve a greater good.  

While we are not a 'B Corp' we look to the World's B Corps for inspiration and example of putting community at the heart of what they do.  

We believe in the importance to serve those in need locally over the maximization of profit: we have begun a partnership that engages the services of local community organizations whose mission is to improve the quality of life for individuals with disabilities through vocational and related programming to produce the kits from our sourced materials.  

### High Temp & Industrial Versions
Higher service temperature versions of both both 100C and 120C have been developed and are at this time, custom order options. Please contact us through the web form for details.

### White Box / Bulk buy
In response to customer inquiry, bulk packs of Euclid Probe are available at slight discounts to printer builders and integrators. Please contact us through the web form for details.

### DIY Build  
The gerbers for DIY boards are hosted at OSHPark and Aisler. No part of the purchases made at OSHPark or Aisler benefit the creators of Euclid Probe. There are no affiliate links or royalties paid on these transactions.  

These PCBs are the same circuitry as the production version. These PCB's are the original design where the same PCB can be used for the tool board or probe board.  We try to update them as we update the other boards to be consistent. The rest of the suggested parts are listed in the DIY BOM. We understand that the availability for some of the specified parts has recently become difficult- this affects us too. 

A note about the relative differences in source pricing- Aisler costs run a little higher because they donate a portion of their profits to KiCAD development at CERN. We use KiCAD and don't mind paying a little more for this. The production of Aisler boards also seems to be done in the EU and then get shipped to other parts of the world. OSHPark is made in Oregon, USA and shipped as well.
