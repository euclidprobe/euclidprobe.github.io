## How to get Euclid Probe

### Buy a kit from a reseller 

Due to regular inquiry and subsequent customer demand, we have begun producing kits of parts available through select resellers.  Part of these sales directly support both the creators of Euclid Probe and the resellers. These funds provide for further research and development for Euclid Probe, the dock and mount creation and adaptations, and the firmware improvements. 

Higher temp versions, both 100C and greater than 120C have been developed and are at this time, custom order options through the creators.

### DIY Build  
The gerbers for DIY boards are hosted at OSHPark and Aisler. No part of the purchases made at OSHPark or Aisler benefit the creators of Euclid Probe. There are no affiliate links or royalties paid on these transactions.  

These PCBs are the same circuitry as the production version. These PCB's are the original design where the same PCB can be used for the tool board or probe board.  We try to update them as we update the other boards to be consistent. The rest of the suggested parts are listed in the DIY BOM. We understand that the availability for some of the specified parts has recently become difficult- this affects us too. 

A note about the relative differences in source pricing- Aisler costs run a little higher because they donate a portion of their profits to KiCAD development at CERN. We use KiCAD and don't mind paying a little more for this. The production of Aisler boards also seems to be done in the EU and then get shipped to other parts of the world. OSHPark is made in Oregon, USA and shipped as well.
