### Modular Toolboard Mounts

The modular building blocks provided are meant to be integrated into users own printer and other CNC machine designs. They are provided in surface mounted and recessed configurations, with pilot holes for M2.5 self tapping screws, M3 tap pilot holes and bores for M3 heatserts.

The toolboard was designed to locate the clearance hole for the JST-XH socket far enough away from common sized M3 heatserts so that a reasonable wall thickness could be maintained in 3D printed mounts.

### 5015 Fan Mount
The 5015 Fan mount prints in 2 halves. Each half is different by design.
There is 1.5mm added clearance in the LeftP1.5 part for a sheet metal bracket if your printer uses one. If the sheet metal bracket is on the right, mirror both parts in your slicer.
The LeftV4 .stl has 0 side clearance.

The RightV4 .stl has 0 side clearance.
There are +5/-2mm vertical adjustment in the mount as shown.

There are +5/-2mm vertical adjustment in the mount as shown.

### 4020 Fan Mount
The 4020 fan mount prints in 2 halves. Each half is different by design.
There is 1.5mm added clearance in the Left part for a sheet metal bracket if your printer uses one. If the sheet metal bracket is on the right, mirror both parts in your slicer. If your printer does not have a sheet metal bracket, an M3 washer will take up the gap.
The Right .stl has 0 side clearance.
There are +5/-2mm vertical adjustment in the mount as shown.
