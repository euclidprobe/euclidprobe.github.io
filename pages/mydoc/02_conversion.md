# Euclid Probe Conversion Mounts 
Below are the conversion mounts designed buy Euclid Probeâ€™s team to replace other probe technologies on existing printers.

Determine the best orientation of the tool board and probe before assembly. 

The orientation of the tool board does not necessarily have to match the orientation of the probe. 

The probe is designed to enter the dock like an arrow, the wider section self-centering the PCB in case of misalignment. 

The 'arrows' can point in opposite ways. In fact, this is the orientation for an i3 style printer like an Ender3 or Wanhao i3, where the tool board motion points it to Xmin and the probe entering the Y-moving dock towards Xmax.
