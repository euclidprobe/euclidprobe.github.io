## TL:DR 
Determine the orientataion of the top tool board and probe before assembly. 

The orientation of the tool board does not nescessarily have to match the orientation of the probe. 

The probe is designed to enter the dock like an arrow, the wider section self-centerting the PCB in case of misalignment. 

The 'arrows' can point in opposite ways. In fact, this is the best orientaion for an i3 style printer like an Ender3 or Wanhao i3, where the tool board motion points it to Xmin and the probe entering the dock to Xmax.
