Frame mounted Voron Trident Mount
This version of the Voron Trident mount was collaboratively developed with Trident users to be located at the left-rear motor mount. It requires the replacing the motor mount screws to M5x20 and utilizes an M5x16 screw and nut to connect the dock to the mount. There is a keyhole to insert the nut into the adjustment channel.
