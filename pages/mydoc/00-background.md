## Our inspirations

The initial design and foundations were laid when the creator purchased a Wanhao Duplicator and was plagued with inconsistent first layers and sought to add a Z-probe to the printer with the hopes improving it. The first probe created was an adaptation of the <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:315698">' semi-automatic probe'.</a> The initial probe was a hard wired, hand deployed endstop switch on a clamp. While this worked well, it was tedious to mount and un-mount. Instead of clamping the probe body to the carriage, magnets were used to attach and register it to the steel carriage where the cooling fan supports were. 

Then, seduced by the siren's song of better probes, a number of other devices were tried that showed promise and were reputed to be more user friendly. Ultimately, nothing seemed to work as well matching the accuracy that the microswitch provided.

The Euclid Probe was was then adapted for use with RepRap Firmware and wesc's <a href="https://github.com/CroXY3D/CroXY">CroXY 3D Printer</a>, and then adapted to  <a href="https://github.com/eclsnowman/Eustathios-Spider-V2.5">Eustathios-Spider V2. </a> 

Euclid Probe has since been successfully been implemented on Railcore, Ender3, Ender5, V-Core3/Rat-rig, Voron 2.4 and Wanhao Duplicator i3 printers. Various mount files are included in the CAD and stl folders.
