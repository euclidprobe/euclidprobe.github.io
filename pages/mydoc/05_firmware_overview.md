### Locating Probe Offsets
The probe offset position relative to the nozzle is needed in all firmware configurations. The following image shows the probe location that used in some of the following firmware examples.

While having a CAD model is nice to reference, its not a requirement. A simple ruler, held on edge can be used to measure the centerline distances between the magnets and the nozzle.

Another good resource for determining the probe offsets is discussed on this <a href="https://duet3d.dozuki.com/Wiki/Test_and_calibrate_the_Z_probe#Section_Here_is_an_easy_way_to_measure_the_offset" target="blank">Duet dozuki page.</a>  

{% include tip.html content="Configure the Z probe offset at the temperatures that you will most be printing at: nozzle, bed and chamber. The offset will vary if you calibrate at 180C nozzle, 50C bed and 20C chamber/ambient compared to 245C nozzle, 100C bed and 60 chamber!" %}

### Probing Speeds
In general terms, we recommend singe probing speeds of 2mm/sec to start with.  
If your firmware can perform 2-speed probing, 5mm/sec & 2mm/sec would be reasonable starting points.  

We recommend that users perform their own repeatability tests to fine tune the speeds if faster speeds are desired. 

Here is the previous example of a single switchâ€™s probing results performed at room temperature. Note the trends of the blue vertical bars showing the trigger point in the speed ranges noted at the top.   

Also note the population of the probe points in relationship to the standard of deviation bars noted in orange. The standard of deviation bars are for the total population.
