## Mounts by Printer Railcore
Page currently undergoing maintenance. 

The following .zip files includes .step and .DXF files of all the modular docks and mounts for CAD interchange.

RailCore native Y-carriage mounts are offered in 3 varieties:

713 Maker Milled Aluminum Plate / Standard Printed Y-Carriage
MRW S/D plate
Petsfang cooling shroud mount.
The toolboard is attached to the mount with 2-M3x8 or M3X12 screws, either from above or below- drill & tap as needed.

The preferred RailCore dock is the 2-part version that mounts to the bottom of the rear extrusion. It is the shortest and therefore the stiffest dock and mount in the offerings. If no extra nuts were placed in the channel, then a number of different options exist:

Loosen the belts, remove a corner cube, pop new nuts in the channel and reassemble. It’s a simple yet tedious, 20 minute process. the most direct remedy.
Use a rotary tool with a burr to enlarge a section of the extrusion to pass a nut. It is advised that a vacuum be used in conjunction with the rotary tool to prevent chips from migrating into places they shouldnt.
Use the provided below drilling jig with either a 6mm or 1/4″ drill bit to spot a hole in the channel. The drill bit is angled 5 degrees to make drill access BEWARE: drilling the edge of the extrusion this way can bind the bit edges and cause strain in the drill. Uses M3 heatserts and M3 screws to expand the ears into the channel. The Print in Place supports should be severed with a hobby/craft knife to release the ears so they can snap into the channel.
The other alternative is the clip-on dock mount has been designed to snap onto the back left vertical extrusion and provides for adjustment in X & Y (Z being achieved by sliding the mount up and down). The clamp uses 3-M3X10 screws through the face of the bracket into M3 heatserts set in the back. The L-shaped adjuster and dock attaches to the mount with an M3x12 draw-bolts and nuts. We recommend that the dock get positioned as close as possible to the vertical extrusion.
