## How to get Euclid Probe
### DIY Build
The gerbers for DIY boards are hosted at OSHPark and Aisler. 

BOM in the DIY Build instructions.

No part of the purchases made at OSHPark or Aisler benefit the creators of Euclid Probe. There are no affiliate links or royalties paid on these transactions.  

These PCBs are the same circuitry as the production version. These PCB's are the original design where the same PCB can be used for the tool board or probe board.  We try to update them as we update the other boards to be consistent. 

The rest of the suggested parts are listed in the DIY Build Instruction. We understand that the availability for some of the specified parts has recently become difficult- this affects us too. 

A note about the relative differences in source pricing- Aisler costs run a little higher because they donate a portion of their profits to KiCAD development at CERN. We use KiCAD and don't mind paying a little more for this. The production of Aisler boards also seems to be done in the EU and then get shipped to other parts of the world. OSHPark is made in Oregon, USA and shipped as well.
