summary: Duet 2 / RepRap Firmware 3.x Firmware Settings
---
### Probe device configuration
Probe is configured as type P5 (from RepRapFirmware 1.14 on), a normally closed switch for bed probing between the IN and GND pins of the Z-probe connector (Duet 0.8.5 and Duet 2 WiFi).

For more reference information see <a href="https://duet3d.dozuki.com/Wiki/M558#Section_M558_in_RepRapFirmware_Num_3" target="blank"> Duet3D gcode wiki</a>

### Setting Z Elevation
Narrative is written in general terms, using gcode commands. The process is basically starting with a known Z probe offset and then adding/subtracting the difference of the true and relative positions. Figure on doing it twice- once cold and then hot if you want more accurate height.  If you have extrusion remnants on the nozzle, preheat to 130-150C to soften the plastic and wire the nozzle clean. 

A feeler gauge of known thickness is needed for this procedure. Examples-

   - 20# bond paper is about 0.1mm, or 0.004 inches
   - 0.2mm feeler gauge is ideal, 0.008in is close (0.207mm)
   - Brass or stainless steel feeler gauges are recommended even though they cost a little more because the stainless steel is non-magnetic and the wont rust.  
     0.2mm – 1/2″x12″ stainless steel as an example <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/2300A9/" target=blank>https://www.mcmaster.com/2300A9/</a> $2.88  
     0.2mm – 1/2″x12″ Carbon Steel as an example <a href=
     https://www.mcmaster.com/2283A9/">https://www.mcmaster.com/2283A9/</a> $1.98
   - measure any long and thin object you can manipulate. Bare PCB boards are reliably 1.6mm thick. 
   - Pokemon cards are reputed to be EXACTLY 0.2mm thick
   - Paper matchbook covers are 0.013 inch. or 0.35mm thick. Credit cards are around 0.03 inches, or 0.762mm thick. 

{% include tip.html content="Anything will work as long as you can measure and verify the thickness.  Stainless steel feeler gauges are recommended even though they cost a little more because the stainless steel is non-magnetic.  " %}


1. Assign an initial Z probe offset SMALLER than you will actually use to stop the probe HIGHER off the bed.  
In RRF ``` G31 … Z2.5 ``` as example.  

2. Home Z as you normally do.

3. Move the carriage to a point on the bed where its going to be easy to access with a strip of paper / feeler gauge.
 - ``` G1 X100 Y100 ```
 
4. Creep the nozzle down to touch it off on the feeler gauge. If you have a display or machine console, use that to save yourself some work. Otherwise, issue terminal commands to jog down, adjust the move distance to suit.  

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``` G91 ; set the machine into relative coordinates mode ```  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``` G1 Z-0.05 ; move the bed UP 0.05mm  ```

   - repeat the small Z motion until you just touch your feeler
   - You will feel a slight drag on the feller when the nozzle is touching it.  Sometimes you can hear slight changes in hot end fan if its running when the nozzle just touches. 
   - Once you touch off the nozzle to the feeler gauge, set the machine’s Z position to that height.   

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ``` G92 Z0.2 ; set the Z axis to be the value of the feeler gauge 0.2 in this example  ```  

5.  Probe the spot you are at. Use a single probe command to report the probe position when it triggers. Pay attention to the G-code options so at to no reset the Z or probe height.  
```G30 S-1 ; Probe the bed at the current XY position. When the probe is triggered ```   
&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ```;do not adjust the Z coordinate, just report the height which the probe triggered. ```

That reported value is the best starting point to set your Z-probe offset for your system!  

You will have to fine tune this a bit either by redoing the procedure hot, or using baby-stepping when you print. It is often easier to print a single 0.45mm wide perimeter, 0.3mm high around the bed and measure it to fine adjust the Z probe height.  

You can reprobe the SAME spot a few times and average the values: ``` G30 S-1 ``` for example to probe and report the trigger height. The result is the Z probe offset value to use in your config. In this next example line, 2.956  

``` G31 ...Z2.956 ```   

If you really want to get fancy, you can use a g-code macro like this to have the system do it for you probing say 10 points and doing the math.

findZprobeoffset.g

``` cpp 
;***  
; findZprobeoffset.g  
; ***  
; the system must be homed before running this macro

; make sure that the nozzle is properly gapped with known height gauge before the start of the test
; Preheat nozzle to 130, clean nozzle, touch off nozzle to 0.2mm feeler gauge, G92 Z0.2
