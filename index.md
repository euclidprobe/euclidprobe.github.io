The highly accurate, magnetically coupled Z-Probe that is not affected by bed temp, bed material, magnetism or surface treatment. Capable of operating up to 80C natively.

Euclid Probe uses screw attached magnets to a PCB for both mechanical coupling and for electrical contacts and dimensional accuracy. It is simply the most reliable and secure method for attaching the magnets to the parts. The Z-Probe circuit is completed when the probe is attached to the dock.

Magnetic build plates with textured PEI, smooth glass, Buildtak, GeckoTek, Euclid can sense them all!

Swap out build surfaces without fear of changing Z-Probe offsets. 

The probe can be configured to be used as both a standalone Z-probe or used as combination endstop and Z-Probe. 

Works with all firmwares- Duet2 & Duet3 running both RepRap 2.x and RepRap 3.x, klipper, Smoothie and even Marlin! 

Euclid Probe can be manually deployed or automatically deployed via gcode macros and can take advantage of your firmware’s probe pickup detection scheme to ensure probe pickup and docking.

<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid'>Euclid of Alexandria</a> was a Greek mathematician, often referred to as the "father of geometry."  It seemed fitting to name the probe that defines a plane after him.

## News

### NEW EUCLID PROBE VERSIONS!

#### Pinout revised to SIG-GND-VCC
Shipping November 14, 2021, the PCB board connector pinout has been updated to be SIG-GND-VCC to match most controller pinouts so that a premade straight-thru cable can be used instead of re-pinning a cable or making a custom cable.

#### M2.5 Self Tapping screws added to the kits 
In addition to the new pinout, we are including M2.5 size self tapping screws for plastic. This will make it easier to mount your Euclid to the provided mount designs with these screws, but still provide the option for tapping the PCB with M3 threads.

#### 24 Volt Native version
There is a new variant of Euclid that is 24V capable! This board will work with all controllers and voltages up to 24V, but specifically designed to support the 24V Z-probe options of the boards like Fystec Spider and BTT Octopus controllers. The components have been to selected to handle the higher voltages.

### NEW DOCKS AND MOUNTS

#### Voron MGN12 
We have published a native mount Clockwork1 X-Carriage for MGN12 rails

#### Voron 2-MGN9 
We have published a native mount Clockwork1 X-Carriage for 2-MGN9 rails

#### Voron Trident
In addition to updating the existing collection of probe mounts and docs, we are busy developing new mounts and docks for printers. 
We are pleased to announce that a native dock and mount have been developed for Voron Trident. See the Mounts page for Voron these parts.

#### Railcore by 713Maker
In collaboration with 713maker.com there now exists a super-lightweight machined 7075 aluminum aircraft alloy for RailCore printers! The mount weighs in at a mere 6.5 grams- that’s less than the combined weight of the nickel and penny in your pocket! 
It's simply the best, most reliable probe solution for your RailCore 250, the 300 and the ZL/T series.  <a href ='https://713maker.com/en/euclid'> <img src="images\713makercom.jpg"></a>

While you are there check out the matching all metal dock that 713maker has also designed and is producing! The dock is insulated so there is less risk of electronics damage should any part of the probe or magnets short against the dock or frame. 

The dock kit includes specially made T-Nuts, also collaboratively designed, that eliminate the need for printer disassembly to insert additional nuts in the extrusion channel in the case there are no spares. The hardware and fittings are the same 1515 used in the frame assembly, and have an ample range of adjustment to accommodate almost any combination of carriage plates, extruders, fan adapters and hot ends.
