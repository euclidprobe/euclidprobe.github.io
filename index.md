The highly accurate, magnetically coupled Z-Probe that is not affected by bed temp, bed material, magnetism or surface treatment. Capable of operating up to 80C natively, higher temps available.

Euclid Probe™️ uses screw attached magnets to a PCB for both mechanical coupling and for electrical contacts and dimensional accuracy. It is simply the most reliable and secure method for attaching the magnets to the parts. The Z-Probe circuit is completed when the probe is attached to the dock.

## Update 8/6/2023 
We are remiss for not posting and updating sooner; life seems to get in the way somehow ....  

<b> New resellers & Integrators!</b>  
The list of <a href="/00-getting.html#resellers"> resellers </a>and integrators is growing!

We are pleased to announce that Euclid Probe is now being sold by DLLPDF and Advanced 3D Printing! The addition of Euclid Probe compliments to each of their list of exceptional products. 

<a href="https://www.advanced3dprinting.com/shop/" target="blank"><img src="images\A3dp.png" style="width:250px">  &nbsp; &nbsp; Advanced 3D Printing</a>  <img src="images\country\150USA.png">  

<a href="https://dllpdf.com/" target="blank"><img src="images\dllpdf.jpg">  &nbsp; &nbsp; DLLPDF</a>  <img src="images\country\150USA.png">  

We will be announcing more reseller and OEM integrators in the next few weeks! 

Euclid Probe sells only through select <a href="/00-getting.html#resellers"> resellers </a> - that way you can be assured of quality of components and assembly. <b>We do not sell on discount websites or Amazon or ebay.</b>

We have been working furiously to finalize the new Euclid. It has been an interesting learning how, what would seem to be one of the simplest of manufacturing outcomes, can be so hard and problematic to produce. 

High Temp probes are available from us directly. High Temp includes magnets, switches and devices for continuous service at 125C and above. 

MRRF 2023 was a great success. It was nice to see and meet everyone!  


<hr>  
<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid' target="blank">Euclid of Alexandria</a> was a Greek mathematician, often referred to as the "father of geometry."  It seemed fitting to name the probe that defines a plane after him.   
<p>His single, thirteen volume book, <a href='https://www.claymath.org/library/historical/euclid' target="blank"><i>Elements</i></a> is the second best selling book of all time, surpassed only by the Bible.  </p>

## Update 11/3/2022 
Euclid Probes are getting shipped out. Our supply chain has had an episode of the hiccups. Halloween seems to have scared them away.  

## Update 10/26/2022 
October has FLOWN by! ERRF was a great adventure for all. Our CFO and VP of Hooman Resources insisted we take a couple of days after ERRF to recharge with a beach vacation....

<span style="color:RED"><b>STICKERS!!!</b></span>   
We have joined the 21st century and now have Euclid Probe stickers. Drop us a note if you didn't get one at ERRF and we'll post one to you. 

## Update 9/26/2022 
If you recently purchased a kit and are missing a part, please let us know! We will dispatch replacements out direct to you ASAP. 
One of our filling machines malfunctioned and we thought we caught it in time, but it seems a few kits snuck out incomplete. 
As embarrassing as it may be, we are grateful that everyone so far has been patient and understanding while we send out replacements. 

Again, we thank you for your support.  

Stealthburner / Clockwork 2 Euclid Native carriages have been uploaded to the Voron stl's folder

## Update 9/21/2022: 
Things have been quiet here on the Interwebs.... we have been busy working on developing the next versions of Euclid Probe and some accessories. 

We will be in attendance at the <a href="https://eastcoastreprapfestival.com/" target="blank"> East Coast RepRap festival in Bel Air, Maryland
October 8-9, 2022 </a>
 <div style="width:100%;text-align:center;"> We will have the new models on display along with demo machines showing deployments on klipper, Marlin and RRF2

## Update 6/29/2022: 
We are MRRF'd out! WE spend the weekend at MRRF as guests of one of our resellers, 713Maker.  It was really nice to get feedback from users and field questions from folks who were interested. And yes, those ARE magnets holding the sign up....

## Update 5/10/2022:  
The wheels keep turning here - our newest shipment of magnets has arrived and are being deployed with the latest kits. The North polarity is now marked on the magnets. Hopefully this will make installation and verification easier.

## Update 4/28/2022  
We are keeping up with order fulfillment. We have struggled with supply chain issues as many of our kindred companies and resellers have by the ongoing COVID situations abroad.  We thank everyone for their continued support.

Available at your reseller- Euclid Inteconnect Cable. Pre-terminated and correctly polarized 22 gauge interconnect cables allow you to quickly connect your Euclid probe to a toolhead or CAN-bus toolboard.  
<br>Constructed of three properly color coded, UL3266, 22 gauge stranded wires, they are 185mm long and are rated to 125C.  They are beefy, they are tough. They won't let you down like other wires. 
<br> The irradiated cross-linked polymeric insulation possesses remarkable mechanical and electrical properties, and great flame resistance. This means that your wire insulation will not get soft or burn up under normal usage. If you are printing in the forges of Mandalor, it will probably work there too.  

The standard Euclid kit has both Dupont and JST connector housings and crimps. We've also sent resellers some Molex Micro-Fit 3.0 connect kits and Molex KK style connector kits for the users who may have a kitted harness or use Duet hardware to make their connections. Ask you reseller if you need one to make you install easy!

<hr>

Magnetic build plates with textured PEI, smooth glass, Buildtak, GeckoTek, Euclid can sense them all!

Swap out build surfaces without fear of changing Z-Probe offsets. 

The probe can be configured to be used as both a standalone Z-probe or used as combination endstop and Z-Probe. 

Works with all firmwares- Duet2 & Duet3 running both RepRap 2.x and RepRap 3.x, klipper, Smoothie and even Marlin! 

Euclid Probe can be manually deployed or automatically deployed via gcode macros and can take advantage of your firmware’s probe pickup detection scheme to ensure probe pickup and docking.

## News

### NEW EUCLID PROBE VERSIONS!

#### Pinout revised to SIG-GND-VCC
Shipping November 14, 2021, the PCB board connector pinout has been updated to be SIG-GND-VCC to match most controller pinouts so that a premade straight-thru cable can be used instead of re-pinning a cable or making a custom cable.

#### M2.5 Self Tapping screws added to the kits 
In addition to the new pinout, we are including M2.5 size self tapping screws for plastic. This will make it easier to mount your Euclid to the provided mount designs with these screws, but still provide the option for tapping the PCB with M3 threads.

#### 24 Volt Native version
There is a new variant of Euclid that is 24V capable! This board will work with all controllers and voltages up to 24V, but specifically designed to support the 24V Z-probe options of the boards like Fystec Spider and BTT Octopus controllers. The components have been to selected to handle the higher voltages.

### NEW DOCKS AND MOUNTS

#### Voron MGN12 
We have published a native mount Clockwork1 X-Carriage for MGN12 rails

#### Voron 2-MGN9 
We have published a native mount Clockwork1 X-Carriage for 2-MGN9 rails

#### Voron Trident
In addition to updating the existing collection of probe mounts and docs, we are busy developing new mounts and docks for printers. 
We are pleased to announce that a native dock and mount have been developed for Voron Trident. See the Mounts page for Voron these parts.

#### Railcore by 713Maker
In collaboration with 713maker.com there now exists a super-lightweight machined 7075 aluminum aircraft alloy for RailCore printers! The mount weighs in at a mere 6.5 grams- that’s less than the combined weight of the nickel and penny in your pocket! 
It's simply the best, most reliable probe solution for your RailCore 250, the 300 and the ZL/T series.  <a href ='https://713maker.com/en/euclid'> <img src="images\713makercom.jpg"></a>

While you are there check out the matching all metal dock that 713maker has also designed and is producing! The dock is insulated so there is less risk of electronics damage should any part of the probe or magnets short against the dock or frame. 

The dock kit includes specially made T-Nuts, also collaboratively designed, that eliminate the need for printer disassembly to insert additional nuts in the extrusion channel in the case there are no spares. The hardware and fittings are the same 1515 used in the frame assembly, and have an ample range of adjustment to accommodate almost any combination of carriage plates, extruders, fan adapters and hot ends.
